# Blue_PERN_Server

## Learning React

#### What are the requirements for the application to be considered Minimum Viable Product(MVP)?

**Server**

Must be written using Node
Have AT LEAST two (2) tables in your database (user, media)
One (1) of those tables must be a ‘users’ table that stores user information 
One (1) of those tables must implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality
Must support session validation with JWT
Must encrypt sensitive material such as passwords
Must include AT LEAST 8 API endpoints
2 for each 
Must be deployed with Heroku

**User story:**
Sometimes I have trouble deciding what to read next. I would like a website that allows me to search by specific criteria like genre to help me decide what to read. I would also like to be able to store things I am interested in so I can come back and look at that list later. 

### Mission Statement

To allow users to create their own account that allows them to browse and store information on media types such as movies, books, and games.  Users will be able to save a list of media descriptions, ratings, etc.. on their account.
